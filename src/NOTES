~~~ RISC_Machine ~~~
    The struct RISC_Machine contains information regarding a specific instance
    of the RISC virtual machine. Generally, only one RISC_Machine will operate
    on a given host, except in special cases (specific networking, testing,
    etc.). In an ideal environment, functions and modules shall pass either
    copies of specific members/details of a struct instance (see docs or headers
    for more info) or a pointer to an entire instance.
